  <div class="sectiontext"><b>Avoid Repetition</b>
    <P>One of the most fundamental rules of coding is to avoid repetition.  Repetition leads to bloat and execution ineffidiency.  The more code you have, the more the computer or browser needs to interperate.  Bloated code can cause loading delays, increased memory usage, increased development cost, and security issues, among other things.  There are many ways to reduce repetition, and it is important to write as efficiently as possible.</p>
    <p><b>Code, Test, Refine</b></p>
    <p>When you are developing you want to follow a high level method called <em>code, test, refine</em>.  We will start with a large idea, and begin breaking it down to its smaller components.  We can't expect to sit down in a single marathon session, and come out with a fully baked perfect work.  <em>Not even the best, and most experienced coders will write perfectly the first time</em>.  We need to work in stages.  We code, test it, and continue to refine it until we get to the end product.</p>
    <p><b>Structure</b></p>
    <p>Code needs to follow specific structures.  In many cases the structure is hierarchical, with one element capable of containing many other elements within it.  This is similar to a family tree, and with HTML it is called tree-like structure.  It is important to remember the structured concept when writing in any language.  Many tools exist to assist in maintaining structure throughout the documents.</p>

<div class="sectiontext">
      <p>We don't have to know everything about every language.  We have access to the best knowledge resources every created - <em>The Internet</em>.  Below arelinks to some of the reference websites we have used.  The links will be updated throughout the course.</p>

 <div class="sectiontitle"><h2>Languages</h2></div>
      <div class="sectionsubtitle"><h3>HTML</h3></div>
<div class="sectiontext">
      <p><b>The Internet</b></p>
<p>The internet is a computer network, allowing computers all around the world to communicate with eachother.  Many of the communciations on the internet contain the infomration required to display web pages on a computer.  The communication for a web page is kicked off when a person opens a browser and types the destination <em><b>URL</b></em> into the browser window.  The browser uses the address to send a request to a server.  The browser works with the computer and other servers to convert the URL to the server address.  The server will respond with the information requested in <b>HTML</b> format.</p>
      <p><b>HTML</b></p>
<p><em><b>HTML</b></em> stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is the code that is read by the browser to tell the computer what to display.  The code contains the elements that make up the webpage.  The basic tags add stylistic elements to the page, but tags are also used to add images, or links.</p>
  <p><b>Structured Pages</b></p>
    <p>Websites are structured into boxes.  Each box can be given different attributes by using code.</P>  
  <p><b>Code Types</b></p>
<p>HTML, CSS, and Javascript all have different purposes.  <b>HTML</b> can be thought of as the structure of a house.  The bedrooms, kitchen, and foundation are all structural components of a house.  <b>CSS</b> files are the style components of the house.  The color of the paint or the carpets can be thought of as CSS styles.  <b>JavaScript</b> adds interactive elements to the house.</p>
<b>Boxes</b>
<p>Every element of a web page can be broken down into boxes.  When you see a web page think about how the page can be broken down into boxes.  This is called <b><em>boxifying</em></b>.  Different shapes are created via styles.</p>  
<b>Elements</b>
<p>Elements are either inline or block and are created from a start tag to an end tag, with the content between the tags.  Block elements create a separation from other elements by creating an <em>"invisible"</em> box around them.  <b><em>Developer Tools</em></b> can  be used to view different elements and their respective style attributes within a page.  Right clicking an element on a page and selecting <em>inspect element</em> takes you directly to the style and element information in the developer tools window.</p>

<div class="sectionsubtitle"><h3>CSS</h3></div>
<div class="sectiontext">
  <p><b>Overview</b></p>
  <p>CSS is an acronym for <em>Cascading Style Sheets.</em>  CSS is a set of rules that determine the style of a webpage based on definitions and attributes.  If no style is defined for a website in the HTML code, the browser will use its default formatting options to display the site.</p>
    <p>CSS works on an <em><b>inheritance</b></em> basis.  This is very important.  Inheritance means that the most specific rule applies first and prevents repetetive code.</p>
  <p><b>Usage</b></p>
  <p>CSS styles are written in a separate file from the HTML code.  The HTML code must call the file in the header.</p>
    <br><em>Example:</em> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="notesstyle.css"
  <p>CSS uses selectors to define and apply styles.  Styles can be applied to all elements of a certain type, by defining classes, or in line.  Defining styles in line is a bad idea.  Styles are written in the form of an attribute:<em>value</em>.</p>
  <br><em>Example:</em>.sectiontitle{color:green;max-width:500px;}
  <p>There are many CSS attributed that can be used.  A link to the CSS attributes and usage can be found in the tools section above.  One common usage of CSS is to deine box size and position after boxifying the page.</p></div>
